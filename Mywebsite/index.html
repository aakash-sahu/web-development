            <p>A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where connections between nodes form a 
                directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs.
                 This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition[1] or speech recognition.</p>

            <p>ecurrent neural networks were based on David Rumelhart's work in 1986.[5] Hopfield networks - a special kind of RNN, were discovered by John Hopfield in 1982.</p>
